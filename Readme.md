## Amazon Clone

Showcasing my skills in HTML and CSS, I've built this compelling Amazon clone! This project demonstrates the ability to create dynamic and user-friendly web interfaces using these essential web development languages.

## Dynamic Border:

Hover over the navigation bar and watch the border transform! It seamlessly matches the vibrant orange of the Amazon smile logo, adding a touch of visual flair.

## Sticky Navigation:

Never lose sight of your search again! The navigation bar stays fixed at the top of the page as you scroll, ensuring effortless searching throughout your shopping journey.

## Exciting Enhancements Ahead:

This is just the beginning! Stay tuned for even more exciting updates and features that will further elevate your shopping experience.
